# Discord bot to forward messages from Discord Channel to Telegram Channel

## Using [selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html) library (Only tested on Windows)

This project will send all new messages from a channel to a Telegram Channel/Bot/Group/Chat without using Discord bots so you don't have to be an administrator of the Discord group you want to forward the message from.

If you are the administrator of the group we will be creating a Discord bot for this task (Q3 2021).

### Step 1

Install [geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) for Windows on this directory.

## Step 2

Add your Discord name and password to keys.py file.
